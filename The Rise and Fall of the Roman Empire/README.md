Title: The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire
History: The Roman Empire was established in 27 BCE by Augustus Caesar and expanded over the course of several centuries to become one of the largest and most powerful empires in history. However, the empire eventually fell due to a combination of military defeats, economic instability, and political corruption. The empire officially came to an end in 476 CE when the last emperor, Romulus Augustus, was deposed by the Germanic leader Odoacer. Despite its eventual collapse, the Roman Empire left a lasting legacy in art, architecture, law, language, religion, and other cultural aspects that continue to influence modern Western society.
