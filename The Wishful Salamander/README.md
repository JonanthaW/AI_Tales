The Wishful Salamander

Once upon a time, there was a Salamander who was known to grant wishes. People from far and wide traveled to seek his help to fulfill their deep desires. The Salamander lived in a small pond in the woods and was surrounded by a mystical aura that had a strange power to fulfill any wish.

The Salamander was a good creature and always helped people, but there was a catch. Each wish that he granted came with a terrible price. The price could be anything from losing a loved one to losing one's own life. The Salamander tried to explain this to everyone who came to seek his help but few listened to his warnings.

One day, a young boy named Tom came to the Salamander and wished for a beautiful house. The Salamander granted his wish, but Tom's family had to give up all their wealth in return. They were forced to live on the streets and beg for food.

Another time, a woman named Mary wished for eternal beauty. The Salamander granted her wish, but she turned into a statue soon after. Her beautiful face was frozen in time for eternity.

Despite the price, people kept coming to the Salamander, hoping to fulfill their desires. However, the Salamander was deeply disturbed by the consequences of his power. He wished to undo the harm he had caused but had no way of turning back time.

One day, the Salamander disappeared without a trace. The pond where he once lived was now a barren wasteland. People who passed by the pond could hear the Salamander's voice, warning them of the danger of wishing for one's own gain. From that day on, people remembered the tale of the Wishful Salamander and learned to be careful what they wished for.
