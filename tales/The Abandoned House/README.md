Title - The Abandoned House 

History - Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and grand house that stood tall on the outskirts of a small town. It was owned by a wealthy family who had lived there for generations. The house was known for its extravagant parties and lavish lifestyle. However, one day, a tragic incident occurred that changed everything.

The family's eldest son went missing, and despite all efforts to find him, he was never found. The family was devastated by this loss, and soon after, they closed the doors of the grand house and left the town, never to return again. 

As years passed, the once grand house fell into a state of disrepair. The windows were broken, the walls were covered in moss, and the floors creaked with every step. Many locals believed the house was cursed, and no one dared to venture inside.

However, one day, a group of curious children decided to explore the abandoned house. As they entered, the creaking floors and the eerie silence filled them with fear. The furniture was coated in dust, the paintings had long been stripped from the walls, and the hallways were dark and gloomy.

As the children made their way through the house, they heard strange noises coming from the basement. They hesitantly made their way down the creaky stairs and saw a small room. In the room, they found an old trunk filled with photographs of the family who once lived there. 

As they flipped through the pictures, they saw one of a young boy who looked eerily similar to the missing son. Suddenly, they heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Terrified, they quickly grabbed the photographs and ran outside.

As they ran, one of the children turned around for a brief moment and saw a ghostly figure of a young boy standing in the basement. The children never returned to the abandoned house, but the photographs of the family's past remained with them forever, carrying a piece of the house's tragic history.
