The Tale of the Clear Mouse: A Wish Gone Wrong

Deep in the heart of the forest, there lived a rare and mysterious creature known as the Clear Mouse. This mouse was unlike any other, for he possessed a unique ability to grant wishes to those who managed to catch a glimpse of him. People would travel from far and wide just to see the Clear Mouse, hoping to have their deepest desires fulfilled.

One day, a young boy stumbled upon the Clear Mouse while wandering through the forest. He was in desperate need of help and wished for the ability to fly. The Clear Mouse obliged and granted the boy his wish, but as he took to the skies, he soon realized the terrible price that came with his newfound ability. For every minute he flew, he aged ten years. The boy was devastated and wished to fly no more, but it was too late - the damage had been done.

Word soon spread of the Clear Mouse's ability to grant wishes, and many people flocked to the forest to ask for his assistance. Some wished for wealth, while others wished for love or power. Each wish was granted, but at a terrible price. Those who wished for wealth found themselves losing everything they held dear, while those who wished for love were left with broken hearts. And those who wished for power soon discovered it came with a heavy burden.

As more and more people made their way to the forest, the Clear Mouse grew tired of the constant requests and the pain that came with granting them. He longed for a way out, but he was bound to his duty by an unseen force.

In the end, it was a wise old owl who showed the Clear Mouse the way out. He explained that the mouse's true power was not in granting wishes, but in showing people the consequences of their actions. With this newfound knowledge, the Clear Mouse was finally free from his burden, and he disappeared into the forest, never to be seen again.

And so, the Tale of the Clear Mouse became a cautionary one. It warned of the dangers of seeking quick fixes to life's problems, and it reminded people that every wish comes with a price.
