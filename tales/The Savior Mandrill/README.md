He possessed a special gift, one that allowed him to communicate with the animals of the forest, and understand their language. This gift had been passed down through generations of Mandrills and was believed to be a sign of great power.

One day, the wise old Mandrill received a vision from the spirits of the forest. The vision showed him the destruction and chaos that was looming over humanity. The Mandrill felt a calling, he knew he needed to leave his home and travel to the distant land of humans to save them from their impending doom.
