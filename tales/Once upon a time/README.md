Once upon a time, in a far-off land named Edith, there lived a grieving king named Luther. He had lost his wife, the queen, to an incurable disease, and his heart had been shattered into a million pieces. Try as he might, he couldn't shake off his misery and despair.

One day, while wandering through the forest, lost in thought, King Luther came across an old, run-down cottage. That in itself wasn't surprising, but what caught his eye was a plume of smoke rising from the chimney.

Being the king, he was accustomed to having others do his bidding and take care of him, but something about this cottage made him curious.

He walked up to the door and knocked softly, but no one answered. He pushed the door open, and to his surprise, he found an old lady bent over a cauldron, stirring something that smelled like heaven.

"What are you cooking?" he asked.

The old lady turned and looked at him with kind eyes. "Soup," she said.

King Luther had never been a fan of soup, but he was curious nonetheless. "May I have some?" he asked.

The lady smiled and poured him a bowl. "Be careful," she said. "It's hot."

King Luther tasted the soup, and his eyes widened in amazement. It was the most delicious soup he had ever tasted. "What is in this?" he asked.

The old lady just smiled and said, "It's a secret."

King Luther finished his bowl and wiped his mouth. "May I ask for your name?" he asked.

"I'm called Ester," she said. "And what about you?"

"I'm King Luther," he said, surprised at how easy it was to talk to her.

They continued talking, and King Luther found himself telling Ester the story of his lost queen. She listened patiently, and when he was finished, she said, "I can help you."

King Luther was skeptical. "How?" he asked.

"I have a potion," she said. "It can heal a broken heart."

King Luther scoffed at that. "There's no potion that can do that," he said.

"Are you willing to try?" Ester asked.

King Luther thought about it. What did he have to lose? "All right," he said.

Ester went to the back of the cottage and came back with a vial filled with a green liquid. "Drink this," she said.

King Luther hesitated for a moment, but he decided to trust her. He drank the potion, and within seconds, he felt a warmth spread through his chest.

He looked at Ester in amazement. "What did you do?" he asked.

"I don't know," Ester said. "But sometimes, magic just happens."

King Luther felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. He no longer felt the heaviness of his grief. He thanked Ester and promised to come back to visit her.

And he did. Whenever he felt overwhelmed, he went to visit Ester and drank the magic potion. Over time, he became a different person. He was happy again, and he ruled his kingdom with kindness and compassion.

Everyone in Edith noticed the change in their king, and they attributed it to his newfound wisdom. But King Luther knew the truth. It was Ester and her magic potion that had healed him.

And so, the legend of the magic potion spread throughout the land, and people who were grieving or sad traveled long distances to visit Ester and drink her potion.

And King Luther lived happily ever after, with Ester as his friend and confidante. And to this day, the people of Edith believe in the power of magic, and they know that anything is possible.
