"The Cursed Financier"

Once upon a time, there was a vivacious financier known for his ability to grant wishes that his clients desired. Many sought his services, for he was known to have the power of making impossible things happen with just a flick of his wrist.

However, people soon realized that every wish granted by this financier came with a terrible price, one that they were not prepared to pay. The wisher would first experience incomparable delight and joy, but it wouldn't take long for their happiness to be replaced with an inexplicable sense of dread and despair.

The town folk began to whisper and gossip about the "Cursed Financier," as he came to be known, and how he used his powers to manipulate people into making decisions that would ultimately lead them to their downfall.

One day, a young couple came to him to seek his services. They desperately wanted a child after being unable to conceive for years. Without hesitation, the financier granted their wish, and soon after, the couple had a baby boy.

The couple rejoiced in the miracle, but it wasn't long before their son began to show signs of a rare disease that no doctor could diagnose. Days turned into weeks, and soon, the couple found themselves staring at their child's lifeless body.

The couple realized too late that they had paid a terrible price for their wish. They had unknowingly traded their child's life for the dream of becoming parents.

As the story spread throughout the town, the Cursed Financier became known as a malevolent force that destroyed lives instead of fulfilling dreams.

From that day on, people began to stray away from the Cursed Financier, deciding that the price they would have to pay for their wishes wasn't worth the risk. For he was no longer viewed as a savior, but instead, he became known as the ultimate harbinger of doom.
