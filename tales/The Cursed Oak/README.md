Title - The Cursed Oak

History - The Cursed Oak was once a great tree that stood tall and proud in a dense forest. It was said that the tree possessed an incredible knowledge of the world, and many people who ventured into the forest would seek its advice. Word of the tree's magical powers soon spread, and people from all over the region would come to make a wish.

For a long time, the tree was happy to grant wishes to all who came before it, but little did they know that every wish came with a terrible price. The tree was cursed, and whoever made a wish from it would have to face the consequences.

One day, a young boy by the name of Thomas stumbled upon the Cursed Oak. He was lost and afraid, and he couldn't find his way back home. He saw the tree and, out of desperation, made a wish to find his way back.

The Oak granted his wish, and Thomas was thrilled to find himself back in the safety of his home. However, it wasn't long before he realized that something was wrong. Every night, Thomas dreamt of monsters and demons that chased him around his house. He couldn't sleep, and he lived in fear of what would happen to him.

Determined to get rid of his nightmares, Thomas went back to the Cursed Oak and begged it to take away his dreams. The tree granted his wish, but as time went by, he realized that he had lost something more precious - his ability to dream.

The Cursed Oak continued to grant wishes to anyone who came before it, but the price for the wishes became more terrible with each passing day. People who wished for love ended up losing their freedom, and those who wished for wealth ended up losing their souls. And so, the Cursed Oak continued to stand in the forest, its branches reaching for the sky, granting wishes, but at what cost? Only time would tell.
