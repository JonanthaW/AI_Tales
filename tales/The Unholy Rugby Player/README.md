The Unholy Rugby Player - The Tragic Tale of a Vampire's Choice 

Once an ordinary rugby player, Robert never stood out amongst his peers. He was a lowly member of the team, always struggling to perform to their level of skill. But one fateful night, everything changed.

Robert stumbled upon a gathering of vampires in the woods. Fascinated by their otherworldly presence, he cautiously approached them. Little did he know, they had already taken notice of his presence.

Sensing his weaknesses and insecurities, they offered him a proposition he couldn't refuse. They would turn him into a vampire, granting him unmatched strength and agility. In exchange, he would become one of them and dedicate his existence to fulfilling their every whim.

The transformation was painful, but when it was complete, he felt like a new man. Suddenly, he had the strength to outperform anyone on the rugby team. He felt invincible, unstoppable, and immortal.

However, the thirst for blood began to gnaw at him, testing his conscience every passing moment. The rugby player in him wanted to stay true to his humanity and curb his bloodthirsty cravings, but the vampire in him demanded dominance.

After much internal conflict, Robert made his choice. He would continue playing rugby, but every night, he would indulge his vampire instincts, feeding on innocent victims in the shadows.

It wasn't long before his thirst consumed him. His teammates noticed a change in his behavior, as did his coaches and family members. Desperate to control his urges, Robert began training himself to resist the temptation of drinking blood.

But it was a losing battle. The hunger was just too strong.

Eventually, Robert's world crashed down around him. He was caught red-handed, sinking his fangs into a teammate's neck on the rugby field. He had become a monster, a shell of who he used to be.

Forced to flee to the shadows, Robert spent the remainder of his days battling his vampiric tendencies. He was no longer a rugby player - he was a vampire, damned to an eternity of unquenchable thirst.
