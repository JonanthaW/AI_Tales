"The Descent of the Low Rugby"

There was a young rugby player, by the name of Trevor, who lived an ordinary life as a student-athlete. He loved the game of rugby and had a bright future ahead of him. However, one fateful night, after a particularly brutal game, Trevor found himself wandering the streets alone, lost in the darkness.

He suddenly felt a strange craving, an insatiable desire for blood. At first, he thought it was just his body reacting to the intense physical exertion, but the feeling only grew stronger with each passing minute. Confused, he stumbled into an alleyway, where he was attacked by a mysterious figure.

Trevor woke up the next day, covered in blood and with no memory of what had happened the night before. He assumed he had been mugged or had fallen victim to some sort of prank. He went about his day as usual but was plagued by an intense thirst that he couldn't shake off.

Days passed, and Trevor noticed peculiar changes in his body. He had become incredibly fast and agile, his senses heightened beyond measure. His strength had increased tenfold, and he found himself able to take on opponents twice his size with ease.

As the weeks went by, the truth dawned on Trevor – he was no longer human. He was a vampire.

Trevor was faced with a difficult choice – he could either embrace his newfound powers and embrace his vampiric existence or fight against his thirst and maintain his humanity.

The thirst gradually became unbearable, and Trevor found himself struggling to hold back. He began to feed off animals, but the craving persisted, growing ever stronger.

One night, as he was hunting in the shadows, Trevor came face to face with a young woman. She was alone, and her heartbeat quickened as she spotted Trevor. He could smell the fear emanating from her, and he knew what he had to do.

But something within Trevor's soul stirred, reminding him of his humanity. He hesitated, unsure of whether to give in to his thirst or spare the woman's life.

In the end, Trevor chose to fight against his vampiric nature, trying to hold on to his humanity. He turned away from the woman, causing her to run off in terror. The thirst still lingered within him, but he refused to give in to it.

From that day on, Trevor lived his life as a low rugby student while struggling with his inner demons. Sometimes he gave in to his thirst, leaving a trail of victims in his wake, but he always felt guilty afterward. He did everything he could to preserve his humanity, even as he struggled with his vampiric existence until his last breath.
