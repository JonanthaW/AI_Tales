The Tragic Tale of the Wishful Mouse – 

Long ago, there was a clear Mouse who lived in a forest. She was different from the other mice – transparent, glittering, and pure – and mysterious tales circulated among the animals regarding her origins. Some said she was a fairy in disguise, while others claimed she was a ghost of a poor sorceress who had been persecuted by humans.

Despite the Mouse's peculiarities, she was kind and gentle, and her reputation as a wish-granter soon spread beyond the forest. Animals from distant places sought her out, whispering their secret desires, and the Mouse, in her soft voice, promised to fulfill them.

However, it was not long before her reputation took on a darker tone. People who had their wishes granted by the Mouse began experiencing strange and terrible events. A wishing owl who wanted to be the favored pet of a king found himself caged in a small, dark room. A pastured goat who wished for eternal youth saw her companions turn away from her, disgusted by her agelessness. And a little mouse who simply wished for cheese found his appetite insatiable, tearing apart every possible storage, and leaving himself and his family starving.

As the stories of the Mouse’s wish fulfillment spread, the animals became afraid of the consequences of their wishes. Yet they couldn't stop their desire, and so they continued to seek her out, every ask made with trembling hearts.

The Mouse, too, was tormented. She hated to see the suffering caused by the fulfillment of the animals’ wishes, but she was bound to follow through on her promises.

One day, a wise old tortoise came to her and asked for her own wish – not for herself, but for all the animals. She wished for the Mouse's freedom, for release from the curse that had made her a wish-granter. Rather than accepting the wish, however, the Mouse was filled with rage. She had been used and manipulated by the animals, forced to carry the burden of their greed and desires. In her anger, she lashed out and shattered herself to pieces, transforming into the pure and glittering dust that coated the forest floor.

From then on, the animals in the woods were wary of making wishes, knowing that each request came with a terrible price that they were forced to pay – and the clear Mouse was never seen again.
