Title - The Curse of the Golden Hoard

History - In the sleepy town of Arkham, nestled in the valleys of New England, there lived a wealthy family by the name of Upton. Mr. Upton had made his fortune through his extensive dealings in the fur trade and had built a sprawling mansion on the outskirts of town – complete with a well-made upstairs, which looked out over the surrounding countryside.

One day, as the family was going through their father's old letters and documents, they stumbled upon a map that was said to lead to a legendary treasure – hidden deep within the forests that lay beyond the town. The Upton siblings could hardly contain their excitement at the thought of uncovering such a bounty and, without a moment's hesitation, they put together a team to embark on the quest.

Led by the eldest son, the group set out into the woods, following the map's many twists and turns. A thick mist hung over the forests, which grew denser with every step they took. Strange sounds echoed through the trees, and the air grew cold and palpable.

Soon, they came upon a clearing, in the centre of which stood an ancient tree that looked as though it had been standing there since the dawn of time. The map indicated that the treasure lay at the base of the tree, but as they approached it, they were struck by a sudden, gut-wrenching fear.

As they reached out to touch the tree, a bolt of lightning lit up the sky, and a thunderous voice boomed through the air. It warned them of the curse that befell all those who dared to lay claim to the treasure, for it was guarded by malevolent beings that would stop at nothing to protect it.

The eldest Upton sibling, undeterred, disregarded the warning and reached for the treasure, but as he grabbed it, a searing pain shot through his body, and he fell to the ground writhing in agony. His siblings watched in horror as his flesh began to decay before their very eyes.

In the end, they fled the forests, never to return again, leaving behind the cursed treasure and the Upton brother – trapped within the woods forevermore. Rumours say that on the rarest of occasions, the sound of children's laughter can still be heard echoing through the misty trees - a warning that the curse still lives on.
