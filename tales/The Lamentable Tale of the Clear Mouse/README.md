The Lamentable Tale of the Clear Mouse

History:

In a small village nestled deep in the woods, there once lived a clear mouse that was said to possess extraordinary powers. The villagers believed that if one were to capture this elusive creature and ask for a wish, it would grant it without hesitation.

One day, a daring young man ventured into the woods and, to his surprise, found the clear mouse. He begged the mouse to grant him his most fervent wish: to become wealthy beyond his wildest dreams.

The mouse, with a twitch of its tiny nose, granted the man his wish. And as promised, the young man became wealthy beyond measure. He lived in a grand mansion and had all the luxuries he desired.

However, the man soon realized that his wealth had come at a terrible cost. His once loyal friends became envious and greedy, and he was forced to live in constant fear of betrayal. He became so preoccupied with his wealth that he forgot about the simple joys of life.

And so began the legend of the clear mouse, who granted wishes that came with a terrible price.

Title: The Miserable Wish

As the legend of the clear mouse continued to spread, people from all over the world came to the small village to seek out the creature and make their own wishes.

One day, a young girl arrived at the village. She had heard of the clear mouse and desperately wanted to ask for the thing she wanted most: to be loved by all.

The villagers warned her of the terrible price of making a wish from the clear mouse, but the girl was blinded by her desire for love and refused to listen.

She set out into the woods in search of the clear mouse and eventually found it. She asked for her wish, and the mouse granted it with a twitch of its tiny nose.

To her surprise, the girl woke up the next day to find that she was beloved by all. People everywhere flocked to her side, showering her with adoration and gifts.

But just as with the previous wish, the joy of the girl's new life was short-lived. She soon found that people's love for her was shallow and superficial, and she was constantly plagued by fear and suspicion.

Eventually, the girl realized the terrible price she had paid for her wish, and she became inconsolable. She wandered the woods for days, weeping and lamenting her foolishness.

The villagers never saw the girl again, but they could always hear the soft sounds of her sobs echoing through the woods. And from that day forward, they warned all those who came seeking the clear mouse's powers that every wish comes with a terrible price.
