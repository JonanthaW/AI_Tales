Title: The Unfathomable Gift

History:
For as long as he could remember, Pitching had never known peace. From his childhood days, he had always been haunted by a sense of unease. He could feel things around him that the others couldn't. Whenever he entered a room, he could sense the tension in the atmosphere. He would often receive premonitions of things to come, and he was always right. It wasn't until he turned 25 that his gift, or curse as he saw it, manifested itself to its full extent.

There was a terrible accident at his workplace. Pitching's colleagues perished in the accident, but he survived. However, his survival led to him inheriting something terrifying. He woke up with the ability to read minds. At first, he thought it was a joke, but then he heard his colleagues' voices in his head. They were screaming, howling and wailing in agony. It was then that Pitching knew that he had an ability that no one else possessed.

For the first few days, Pitching tried to shut out the voices, but he couldn't. They were relentless, and they wouldn't stop. They spoke to him in different languages, and he could understand them all. He soon realised that he needed to accept his gift if he was to make sense of it.

As the weeks went by, Pitching started to understand his gift better. He found that he could also see into the memories of the people whose minds he was reading. The more he delved into their memories, the more terrifying they became. He saw a world that was dark and bleak, filled with unimaginable horrors that only existed in nightmares.

Pitching knew that he had to find a way to control his gift, but he couldn't. The more he used it, the more he felt like he was losing his mind. He started to see things that weren't there, and he heard voices that didn't make sense. He was haunted by the images from other people's minds, and he knew that he was slowly but surely losing his grip on reality.

One day, Pitching came across a group of people who were chanting strange incantations in a dark alleyway. He listened in, and he could hear them calling upon ancient beings that were supposed to have long been forgotten. Suddenly, he felt a presence in his mind, something that he had never felt before. It spoke to him, and it offered him salvation, but at a terrible price.

Pitching knew that he had to make a choice. He could either embrace his gift fully, giving into the horrors that existed in the darkness, or he could reject it and try to live a normal life. As he stood there, the voices in his head screaming out terror, he realised that he had already fallen too far. The choice was no longer his to make, and soon he would be lost forever to the unfathomable terrors of the mind.
