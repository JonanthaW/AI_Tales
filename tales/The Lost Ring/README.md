Title - The Lost Ring

History - It was a beautiful summer day when Lilly decided to go on a hike in the woods behind her house. She was an adventurous girl, always ready to explore new places. As she walked deeper into the woods, she stumbled upon an old abandoned house. It was a creepy-looking house that sparked her curiosity. She decided to explore it, and as she walked through the rickety old door, she felt some unseen force guiding her.

As she walked through the rooms, she saw ancient artifacts and furniture covered in dust. She decided to take a closer look and stumbled upon an old ring hidden in the corner of the room. It was a beautiful ring with a shining ruby in the middle. But as she picked it up, she noticed an inscription on it that read, "I curse the person who wears this ring and any who touch it."

Lilly, being a brave girl, didn't take the curse seriously and decided to wear the ring. As soon as she put it on, she felt a strange force take over her body, and she started to feel weak. She tried to take the ring off, but it wouldn't budge. As the night fell, Lilly began to feel more and more ill. Suddenly, she heard a voice calling out to her.

The voice was coming from the ruby, and it told her the story behind the ring. The ring belonged to a princess who had fallen in love with a commoner. The king didn't approve of their relationship, and so he cursed the ring, ensuring that none could wear it except his daughter. The ring was later lost, and it was said that anyone who dared to wear it would suffer a terrible fate.

Lilly was afraid, and she wanted to take off the ring, but it wouldn't come off. She was stuck with it. She tried to leave the house, but the doors wouldn't open. She was trapped. She knew that she had to find a way of breaking the curse.

Days turned into weeks, and finally, on the thirteenth day, the curse broke. Lilly took off the ring, and suddenly she felt her strength return. She was relieved to be free from the curse, but she knew she could never come back to that house again.

Years later, Lilly became a great adventurer, and she traveled around the world, exploring new places and discovering ancient artifacts. She had many adventures, but she never forgot the curse of the lost ring. She realized that not every adventure was worth the risk, and sometimes, it was best to let go of the unknown. She had learned her lesson the hard way.
