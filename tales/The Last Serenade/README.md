Title: The Last Serenade

Once upon a time in a village nestled in the rolling green hills, there was a young woman named Stella. She was known throughout the town for her enchanting voice and her talent for playing the harp. Every evening she would walk to the town square and perform, singing the most beautiful songs.

One fateful evening, as Stella walked towards the square, she noticed that the streets were empty. The sky had turned a deep shade of purple, and the moon was full and bright. The silence was broken by the sound of a distant howl. Stella knew that wolves were known to roam the nearby forests and decided to make her way back home.

As she walked down the dimly lit streets, the howls grew louder, and she knew that danger was near. Suddenly, a pack of wolves emerged from the shadows and approached her. Stella stood still, heart pounding in her chest, waiting for the worst.

Unexpectedly, one of the wolves stepped forward and transformed into a man. He had piercing blue eyes and long black hair, and in his human form, he introduced himself as Riven.

Riven was the ruler of the forest and was enchanted by Stella's voice when he first heard it. He had been following her every night, and he confessed that he had fallen in love with her. Stella was taken aback by the confession and initially refused him, but Riven persisted.

Days passed, and Riven continued to shower Stella with affection, bringing her gifts and even protecting the village from danger. Even though Stella was wary of Riven's intentions, she found herself falling for him too. Eventually, they became inseparable, and the villagers grew to accept Riven's presence in the community.

However, all good things must come to an end, and Stella's happiness was short-lived. One evening, while performing in the town square, Stella's voice suddenly became hoarse, and her fingers could no longer play the harp. The villagers were shocked at the sudden change, and the cheerful vibe that once filled the town square turned somber.

Stella became bedridden, and no matter what she did, her voice never returned. She grew weaker each passing day until finally, one morning, Stella passed away.

Riven was heartbroken, and his wolf form returned. He howled at the sky, mourning the loss of his beloved. However, as the last note from her harp faded away, a miracle happened. Stella's voice returned, stronger and more beautiful than ever before. She sang a serenade, a tribute to her love for Riven.

And so, in the quiet of the morning, Riven transformed back to his human form, and the couple shared a final embrace. From that night onwards, Stella's voice could still be heard playing the harp in the town square, and Riven was never seen again. Rumours have it that he still lingers in the shadows, listening to her play - still enchanted by the sound of her voice.
