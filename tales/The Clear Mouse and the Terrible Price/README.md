"The Clear Mouse and the Terrible Price"

Once upon a time, there was a clear mouse who lived in a forest. The mouse was known for granting wishes to anyone who asked for them. Many came to the mouse seeking wealth, love, power, and protection from harm. Each wish the clear mouse granted was followed by a warning - every wish comes with a terrible price.

One day, a young farmer came to the clear mouse, seeking to have his harvest multiplied. The mouse granted the wish, warning him that he would lose something dear to him. The farmer did not heed the warning, thinking that the price would be something minor. The next day, the farmer woke up to find that his daughter was missing, taken by an unknown creature from the forest.

Another day, a wealthy merchant came to the clear mouse, seeking to have his wealth doubled. The mouse granted the wish, but warned him that he would lose something precious. The merchant disregarded the warning, thinking that the price would be small. The following month, the merchant's ship sank in a storm, losing all his goods and the lives of his crew.

Many came to the clear mouse, seeking for their wishes to be granted. Each time, the clear mouse warned them of the terrible price they would pay. Many did not take heed of the warning, losing something they held dear in the process.

One day, a young orphan girl came to the clear mouse, seeking to have her dead parents back to life. The mouse granted her wish but told her of the terrible price she would have to pay. The girl did not listen, thinking that having her parents back was worth anything.

The next day, the girl woke up to find that her parents were indeed back, but they were alive as mice. They could not speak or move other than running on the floor. The girl realized the terrible mistake she made, understanding that the clear mouse granted wishes but every wish came with a terrible price.

From that day on, the clear mouse's power was known throughout the land, feared by many, and revered by those who understood the price and took heed of the warning.
