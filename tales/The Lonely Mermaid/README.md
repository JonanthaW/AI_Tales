Title: The Lonely Mermaid's Wish

In the depths of the sea, there lived a heartbroken mermaid named Lyra. She had always been alone as she feared nobody would accept her for who she was. Lyra had a beautiful voice and would often sing to the creatures of the sea, but nobody ever stayed to listen to her.

Lyra longed for a companion, but she knew that it was impossible for her to find anyone in the sea who would accept her. One day, she swam to the surface and saw a handsome prince on a ship. Lyra was enchanted by his looks and knew that he was the one she had been waiting for all her life.

She sang her heart out to the prince on the ship. The prince was mesmerized by her voice and jumped off the ship to follow the mermaid. Lyra was overjoyed to have someone to call her own, but she knew that the prince was not meant to live in the sea.

They spent many days together, but Lyra's heart was heavy as she knew that she had to let the prince return to his kingdom. With a heavy heart, she watched the prince leave, hoping that he would never forget her.

Days turned into months, and months turned into years, but the prince never returned. Lyra sang her heart out almost every night, hoping that the prince would hear her and come back to her.

One night, as she sang on a rock, a shooting star fell from the sky. Lyra made a wish to be reunited with her prince. The next morning, she saw the prince on the rock she had been singing on the previous night. Tears of joy streamed down her face as she rushed to him.

The prince had never forgotten Lyra, and he had been looking for her all these years. They embraced each other and made a pact to never leave each other's side. From that day on, the mermaid and the prince lived happily ever after, and Lyra never sang alone again.
