Title - The Enchanted Forest

History -

In a land far away,
Where the night meets the day,
Lies a forest deep and enchanted,
Where magic and wonder are implanted.

The trees here grow tall and strong,
Their leaves rustling with a melodic song,
And the ground beneath is covered in moss,
As if nature here had no loss.

Once upon a time, so the stories say,
Fairies and unicorns called this place home to stay,
And their laughter echoed through the trees,
As they flitted around with such ease.

But as time passed by, humans came to explore,
And cut down the trees to build and adore,
The forest was at risk, its magic fading away,
But the fairies refused to let their home sway.

They cast a spell with all their might,
To protect the trees and grant them new light,
And just like that, the forest was transformed,
Into a realm of magic and charm.

Now, those who wander in with an open heart,
Would witness the beauty that sets them apart,
From a world that's mundane and dull,
To a place where magic reigns in full.
