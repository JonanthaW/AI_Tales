Title: The Magical Bird

In the deep and dense forest lived a magical bird. The bird possessed the power to grant three wishes to anyone who caught it. For years, many people had tried to catch it, but no one succeeded. The bird was too quick and too wise for them.

One day, a young boy entered the forest. His name was Jack, and he desperately needed a wish. His mother was critically ill, and he had no money for her treatment. He had heard of the magical bird and decided to try his luck.

As he wandered through the forest, he stumbled upon the bird. The bird was perched on a branch and was singing a melodious tune. Jack approached the bird calmly and spoke to it gently. The bird understood his situation and agreed to grant him a wish.

Jack wished for his mother's health to be restored, and the bird granted it. He returned home to find his mother healthy and happy. Overjoyed, he went back to the forest to thank the bird. The bird was pleased to hear about the successful wish and granted him two more.

Jack thought for a while and wished for unlimited wealth. The bird granted his second wish, and Jack became rich beyond his dreams. The last wish was left, and Jack had a tough decision to make. He had everything he wanted, but he still had a desire to fulfill.

Finally, he wished for the magical bird to be free. The bird was surprised by his wish but granted it nonetheless. The bird flew away, and Jack went back to his life. He had everything he wanted but realized that his happiness came from his mother's well-being and not from the wealth the bird had granted.

From that day on, Jack lived a simple life, and whenever he visited the forest, he would listen to the melody of the magical bird, hoping that it had found its happiness too.
