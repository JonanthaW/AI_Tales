Title: The Enchanted Mirror

Once upon a time, in a far-off village, there lived a young girl named Lily. She was a kind-hearted and beautiful girl who lived with her parents in a small house in the woods. One day, while playing in the woods, she stumbled upon an enchanted mirror. The mirror seemed to have some magical powers, which were intriguing to Lily.

Lily's curiosity got the better of her, and she decided to take the mirror home with her. As she reached home, she suddenly heard a voice from the mirror, "I am the Enchanted Mirror, and I can grant you a wish." Lily was in awe and excitement, but she didn't know what to wish for.

After much pondering, she wished for a golden crown. The mirror granted her wish, and suddenly a golden crown appeared in her hands. Lily was overjoyed, and she ran to her parents to show them the crown. Her parents were in shock, and they were amazed to see the golden crown in her hands.

From that day on, the enchanted mirror became her best friend. She would visit the mirror every day and ask for something new to make her happy. Over time, she grew selfish and only thought about herself, never considering the needs of others.

One day, the mirror stopped responding, and Lily was devastated. She cried and begged for the mirror to respond. Suddenly, she heard a voice from the mirror, "You have been greedy, selfish and only thought about yourself, but you never thought about the needs of others. This is why I have stopped responding to you."

Lily realized the errors of her ways, and she promised to change. The mirror granted her forgiveness and once again bestowed upon her the power of granting wishes. Lily was now more thoughtful and compassionate, and she used her power to help others.

And so, the Enchanted Mirror and Lily became the talk of the town. They helped people in need and became known as the town's heroes. Everyone knew that Lily's heart had changed, and she had become a kind-hearted and selfless person. The Enchanted Mirror had taught her a valuable lesson, and she had learned it well.

In the end, Lily realized that real happiness comes from helping others, and not just oneself. She continued to use her power for the good of all, and the Enchanted Mirror remained her most precious possession, a reminder of the lesson she had learned.
