Title: The Eye of the Dragon

It was a beautiful summer day in the kingdom of Aramore, but before the citizens could enjoy their day, a loud roar shook the ground beneath them. It was loud enough to make some of the buildings collapse, and the ground was shaking badly. In no time, everyone could see a huge black dragon swooping down to the ground, ready to rip the kingdom apart.

The people of the kingdom were all running in different directions, trying to find somewhere to hide. But the dragon was just too powerful to be stopped, and it quickly destroyed the entire kingdom. The citizens of Aramore had no other option but to flee the kingdom and seek refuge in the nearby kingdoms.

A group of brave warriors, led by a young boy named Cyrus, decided to go fight the dragon and save their kingdom from its wrath. They ventured through the forest and the mountains, and their journey led them to a cave at the base of the mountains.

Inside the cave, they found a crystal, shaped like an eye. This was the Eye of the Dragon, the one and only thing that could defeat the dragon. The Eye had the power to absorb the energy of the dragon, and with it, the warriors would be able to use its power against the dragon.

The warriors took the Eye and made their way back to the kingdom, where they found the dragon still wreaking havoc. The warriors positioned themselves strategically and prepared to fight the dragon. As they attacked, the dragon's energy was absorbed into the Eye, and the warriors were able to use its power to weaken the dragon.

In the end, it was Cyrus who landed the final blow, striking the Dragon with the Eye, leaving the once powerful creature weak and defeated. The citizens of Aramore were overjoyed to see their kingdom restored to its former glory, and they all rejoiced in their young hero's victory.

From that day on, the Eye of the Dragon was honored as a symbol of hope and courage, and Cyrus went on to become known as the Dragon Slayer, with his bravery spoken about for many years to come.
