"The Bloody Scrummage"

There was once a lowly rugby player named James. He had always felt like something was different about him, but he never could quite put his finger on what it was. One day, on the field, he was tackled by a teammate and accidentally bit his lip. As he tasted his own blood, an insatiable thirst overcame him. He couldn't control himself and attacked his teammate, biting into his neck and draining him of his blood.

Terrified and confused, James sought out a doctor who revealed the shocking truth: he was a vampire. James tried to maintain his humanity, but the desire for blood was overwhelming. He isolated himself, feeding on small animals to try and stave off the thirst for human blood. But it was never enough.

One night, James stumbled upon a group of people leaving a bar. The smell of their blood was too much for him to resist. He attacked and drained them of their blood, leaving a trail of bodies behind him.

Haunted by his actions, James knew he had to make a choice - continue to feed on humans and live forever as a monster, or end his own life to save others from his thirst.

In the end, James chose to sacrifice himself. He walked into the sunlight and welcomed the fatal burn of the vampire curse leaving his body.

Though he was gone, his legacy lived on. The rugby team still speaks of the bloody scrummage that claimed so many lives, but nobody knew the true story of the vampire that lurked among them.
