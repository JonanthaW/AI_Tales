Title: The Secret of the Abandoned House 

Once upon a time, there was an old and abandoned house at the end of the street. It was rumored that the previous owner had passed away, and no one else had dared to buy the property since. However, there was something strange about the house that no one knew until a group of curious kids stumbled upon it.

One day, four friends - Emma, Sam, Alex, and Lily - from the neighborhood decided to explore the abandoned house. They had heard stories that the house was haunted, but they were determined to find out for themselves. As they ventured inside, they noticed something odd. Despite the years of being unoccupied, the house was in pristine condition.

They explored each room, admiring the grandeur of the architecture and the beauty of the furniture, but something was missing. There were no personal effects or trinkets that indicated the former ownerâ€™s identity.

As they reached the attic, they found a small compartment behind an old wardrobe. They dusted off the cobwebs and opened the compartment door. Inside, they found a small journal that belonged to the previous owner. The journal was filled with strange symbols and diagrams that they couldn't make sense of. However, they sensed that it held a secret.

Feeling the thrill of uncovering a mystery, they decided to take the journal home and study it. As they spent hours poring over the pages, they realized that the symbols were a map to a hidden treasure. Their excitement peaked, and they realized that the supposed haunted house held something much more valuable than ghosts.

The friends pooled their resources and followed the map. It led them to an underground tunnel beneath the house that took them deep into the ground. As they reached the end of the tunnel, they beheld a sight that took their breath away.

There, in front of them, was a massive pile of gold and jewels, worth millions of dollars. The friends couldn't believe their eyes as they realized that the house was indeed haunted- by the treasure of the previous owner.

With their newfound riches, the friends became instant celebrities in their neighborhood. They had discovered the secret of the abandoned house and lived happily ever after, surrounded by wealth and fame.
