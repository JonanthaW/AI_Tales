The Thirsty Scrumhalf - 

In the small town of Ravenswood, lived a lowly scrumhalf named Simon. Despite his lack of physical stature, Simon was a star rugby player for the local team. However, one night after practice, Simon was attacked by a mysterious being and left for dead on the pitch.

Days later, Simon woke up with an insatiable hunger and a newfound sensitivity to sunlight. It wasn't long before he realized that he had become something more than human - a vampire.

Simon struggled with his newfound thirst for blood and his desire to remain human. He tried to suppress his urges by drinking animal blood, but it was never enough. 

One night, while wandering through the dark alleys of Ravenswood, he stumbled upon a group of local thugs who were terrorizing an innocent victim. Without thinking, Simon attacked the thugs and drained them of their blood.

As time went on, Simon found himself struggling more and more with his vampire nature. He continued to play rugby and was even scouted for a big team, but he couldn't shake the guilt he felt from the lives he had taken.

In the end, Simon made a decision. He could no longer deny his true nature and made the ultimate sacrifice by staking himself. 

The people of Ravenswood would always remember Simon as the scrappy little scrumhalf who played with heart and courage, but only few would ever know the truth about the hungry vampire who struggled with his thirst for blood.
