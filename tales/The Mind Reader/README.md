"The Mind Reader's Madness"

Pitching had always been a nervous man, prone to anxiety and paranoia. But one fateful night, he woke up with a bizarre new ability – the power to read minds. At first, he was thrilled by the prospect of being able to know what others were thinking. But soon enough, he discovered that his newfound power was a curse.

As he walked down the bustling streets of his city, Pitching found himself bombarded with a cacophony of thoughts – some mundane, some sinister. He had no way of controlling this flood of information, and it quickly drove him mad.

At first, he tried to use his power for good. He would read the minds of passersby, and try to uncover their secrets or help them with their problems. But as he delved deeper into their thoughts, he began to see a darker side of humanity – one filled with fear, hatred, and violence.

One day, Pitching stumbled upon a group of men scheming to commit a heinous act of terrorism. Horrified, he tried to alert the authorities, but his ramblings about telepathy and mind-reading only got him labeled as a lunatic.

Desperate and alone, Pitching began to retreat into his own mind, spending hours in a state of trancelike meditation in an attempt to drown out the cacophony of voices around him. But even then, the sinister thoughts of others seeped in, driving him to the brink of insanity.

In the end, Pitching was consumed by his own madness. His mind, stretched to the breaking point by the weight of all the thoughts he had absorbed, fractured and shattered irreparably. He spent the remainder of his days locked away in a padded cell, muttering nonsense as he tried to drown out the voices in his head.

To this day, some say that Pitching's power still lingers, manifesting in others who are also driven to madness by the burden of knowing too much about the thoughts of their fellow humans. And those who dare to peer into the darkest corners of the mind, it is said, can still hear the faint echoes of Pitching's tortured thoughts, whispering of the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of our everyday lives.
