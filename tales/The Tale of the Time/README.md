"The Tale of the Time-Travelling Cartload"

Once, in the ancient city of Arkham, there was a ruthless cartload by the name of Mary. She was feared by many, for she would always charge exorbitant prices and would not hesitate to cheat her customers. But one day, as Mary was on her way to the market, something strange happened. 

As she was navigating the dark alleyways, Mary suddenly felt a strange energy coursing through her body. The world around her seemed to ripple and warp, and before she knew it, she was hurtling through time and space. 

When Mary opened her eyes, she realized that she had travelled several centuries back in time. The streets were now deserted, and she was surrounded by a strange, otherworldly aura. But Mary was not afraid - for she knew that with her newfound power, she could rule this ancient world with an iron fist. 

And rule she did. Mary used her knowledge of the future to amass great wealth and power. She bribed officials, started wars, and even plotted to overthrow kings. But as time went on, Mary began to realize the true consequences of her actions. She had upset the delicate balance of time itself, and the world was beginning to decay around her. 

As the world around her crumbled, Mary knew that she had to do something to set things right. In a final act of desperation, she travelled back to her own time and pleaded with the gods to forgive her for her sins. But it was too late. The fabric of time had been torn, and the world would never be the same again. 

And so the tale goes that Mary, the ruthless cartload, had discovered a power too great for any mortal to wield. Her insatiable thirst for power had led to the destruction of history itself, and she would forever be remembered as one of the greatest villains of all time.
