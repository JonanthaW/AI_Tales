Title: The Neon City

History:
In the year 2078, the world was a different place. Technology had advanced to the point where humanity was able to create cybernetic enhancements and implant them into their bodies. The modifications ranged from simple enhancements to more drastic ones, which replaced entire limbs, organs and even the brain.

As society became more and more reliant on technology, a new system of social hierarchy emerged. The wealthy could afford the best enhancements, becoming superhuman in terms of strength, speed and intelligence. The poor, on the other hand, were left to make do with basic enhancements, which barely improved their lives.

The Neon City was the epitome of this new world order. The city was built atop the ruins of an older one and was the hub of the latest and greatest enhancements. The rich flocked to the city in search of the latest implants, while the poor remained outside, living in a world devoid of technology.

The city was a neon-lit metropolis, filling the night sky with a rainbow of colours. The streets were crowded with people, all with various enhancements that granted them superhuman abilities. The city buzzed with life and energy, a testament to humanity's mastery of technology.

But beneath the neon veneer, the city held dark secrets. The wealthy had grown powerful and corrupt, enjoying their superiority over the poor. They ruled with an iron fist, using their enhancements to maintain control. The poor lived in slums, existing in a world that was now too advanced for them to keep up.

The Neon City was a beacon of hope for some and a pit of despair for others. It was a testament to humanity's progress and a reminder of its failings. It was a city full of possibilities, dangers and secrets just waiting to be uncovered.
