Title: The Curious Case of the Squirming Spectacled Snake

Deep in the rainforest, there was a small village where people lived a simple life. One day, a strange and rare species of snake made its way into the village - the squirming spectacled snake. It got its name from its strange habit of wriggling and squirming while wearing oversized spectacles perched on its nose. The villagers were amazed and befuddled by the snake's strange behavior and began to study it closely.

The snake seemed harmless enough and soon became a local attraction. The village children would gather around it and watch in amazement as it squirmed and wriggled about in its enclosure. However, as more and more people came to see the snake, the villagers realized something was amiss.

One by one, the villagers who visited the snake began to fall ill, and their health deteriorated rapidly. The village doctor was at a loss to explain the mysterious illness that was sweeping the village. The village elders decided to seek help from a wise old man living on the outskirts of the forest.

The old man arrived in the village and immediately began to study the situation. After much contemplation, he discovered that the squirming spectacled snake's oversized spectacles were the source of the strange illness. The spectacles were made of a rare stone that contained harmful chemicals, and when these chemicals came into contact with human skin, they caused severe sickness.

The villagers immediately removed the spectacles from the snake, and the snake stopped wriggling and squirming instantaneously, revealing it to be a perfectly placid creature. The villagers then dropped the spectacles in a fire, and they melted harmlessly away.

The wise old man advised the villagers never to trust a spectacle that is too large or too stylish, and he left the village a little wiser than when he arrived. The villagers thanked him for his help and returned to their simple lives, relieved that the squirming spectacled snake was no longer a threat to their health.
