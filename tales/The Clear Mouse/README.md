The Clear Mouse's Curse -

Long ago, in a lush green forest, lived a clear mouse whose fur sparkled in the sunlight. As the legend goes, the mouse had the ability to grant wishes to anyone who caught sight of it. But little did people realize that each wish came with an unbearable price.

The clear mouse lived a mundane life until it was found by a young shepherd who was looking for his lost sheep. The mouse, being grateful to the shepherd for giving it food, granted him three wishes. The shepherd wished for a flock of hundred sheep, a big house, and a loving wife. As the clear mouse granted his wishes, the shepherd noticed a tiny cut on his finger, but he ignored it, thinking it would heal on its own.

The following month, the shepherd's sheep were stolen by thieves, his house caught fire, and his wife left him. The shepherd realized that the clear mouse had granted his wishes, but at a terrible cost. He found the mouse and asked it to undo his wishes. The mouse agreed but warned him that there would be consequences.

The shepherd's first wish was undone, but he lost his sense of taste. The second wish was also undone, but he lost his sight. And when the mouse undid the third wish, the shepherd lost his ability to speak. He realized that the clear mouse's curse was far worse than any wish it could grant.

After that incident, many people saw the clear mouse, and each one of them made a wish. But all of them suffered the same fate as the shepherd. They realized that the clear mouse's curse was too high a price for any wish.

The clear mouse lived in the forest, granting wishes to those desperate enough to take a chance on its magic. After all, while wishes could be granted, they would be paid for through afflictions. Nonetheless, the mouse continued its existence in the wilds, a beautiful yet dread creature preying on people's desires.
