The Misery of the Wishing Mouse

Once upon a time, there was a clear mouse who lived in the forests of England. This mouse possessed a remarkable gift - the power to grant wishes to anyone who stumbled upon it. Over the years, news of the clear mouse had spread far and wide, and people from all over the world came seeking to have their wishes granted.

The clear mouse would prance and dance, its whiskers quivering in excitement, as each new wish was made. And every time, it would fulfill the request with ease, a flash of bright light emanating from its tiny body.

But there was a dark secret that came with the mouse's gift. For every wish granted, a terrible price would be paid. The price could be minor, such as a simple inconvenience, or more severe, such as the loss of a loved one. No wish could be granted without a price, and the higher the magnitude of wish, the higher the price.

At first, people were ecstatic with the clear mouse's miracles. But soon, they began to realize the misery that accompanied their wishes. Some went mad with regret, unable to cope with the prices they had paid. Others sought the clear mouse out, asking it to undo their wishes, willing to pay any price.

But the clear mouse never granted such requests. It pranced and danced as always, granting wishes with abandon, heedless of the suffering it had caused.

As tales of the mouse's wickedness spread, fewer and fewer people came seeking its gifts. Eventually, the clear mouse disappeared, lost to the mists of history. But those who had made wishes still bore the scars of their choices, forever burdened by the misery of the wishing mouse.
